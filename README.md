# Hackerrank Solutions

## Introduction

This Repository contains solution for all Hackerrank challange which I am currently solving. For now, I am focused on the Algorithms, Data Structures and Linux Shell challenges.

## Algorithms
I am currently solving the Hackerrank's Algorithms in three languages

- Javascript
- Python
- Golang

This will also be a helper for mastering new languages. I will come back to solve all Algorithms in any new programming language I pick up. For instance, I plan on starting c# in few months from now which will be necessary in my Kernel development journey. That means I would return to solve the algorithms in C# as well. This will be a means to perfect the new language. This worked well with Python.
