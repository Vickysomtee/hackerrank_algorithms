# Hackerrank Solutions

## Introduction

This Repository contains solution for all Hackerrank challange which I am currently solving. For now, I am focused on the Algorithms, Data Structures and Linux Shell challenges.

## Algorithms
I am currently solving the Hackerrank's Algorithms in three languages

- Javascript
- Python
- Golang

This will also be a helper for mastering new languages. I will come back to solve all Algorithms in any new programming language I pick up. For instance, I plan on starting c# in few months from now which will be necessary in my Kernel development journey. That means I would return to solve the algorithms in C# as well. This will be a means to perfect the new language. This worked well with Python.

### Test Solutions

To run these solutions you need to have Node, Python and Go installed on your machine.

- Move into the solution's directory.

```bash
cd 1-solve_me_first
```

- Run either of these commands for the specific language

#### Python 

```bash
python index.py
```

#### Javascript 

```bash
node index.js
```
#### Go

```bash
go run main.go
```
