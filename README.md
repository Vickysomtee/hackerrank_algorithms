# Hackerrank Solutions

## Introduction

This Repository contains solution for all Hackerrank challange which I am currently solving. For now, I am focused on the Algorithms, Data Structures and Linux Shell challenges.

## Algorithms
I am currently solving the Hackerrank's Algorithms in three languages

- Javascript
- Python
- Golang

This will also be a helper for mastering new languages.

### Test Solutions

To run these solutions you need to have Node, Python and/or Go installed on your machine.

- Move into the solution's directory.

Using solve_me_first algorithm as example:

```bash
cd solve_me_first
```

- Run either of these commands for the specific language

#### Python 

```bash
python index.py
```

#### Javascript 

```bash
node index.js
```
#### Go

```bash
go run main.go
```
